Last Updated: September 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in FlatSketcherApp (the "App").

1. Information We Collect

To provide our services, we collect the following types of information:

Account Information: When you create an account, we collect your email address. This is used for account management, security, and communication purposes. Your user data, including your unique user ID and subscription status, is stored securely using Firebase services.

Image Uploads: The core functionality of the App involves you uploading images of garments, patterns, or objects. These images are sent to Google's Vertex AI platform for processing to generate sketches. We do not store your uploaded images on our servers after the sketch has been generated and returned to you. Google's use of this data is governed by their own privacy policies.

Sketch and Project Data: Sketches you generate and projects you create are associated with your user account and are stored in our secure Firebase database to allow you to access them across sessions.

Transaction Information: If you purchase a subscription, the transaction is processed by Apple through their App Store In-App Purchase system. We do not collect or store your credit card details. We only receive a confirmation token from Apple that a purchase was made, which we use to update your account to a "Pro" status.

With Service Providers: We share your uploaded images with Google's Vertex AI for the sole purpose of generating sketches.

For Legal Reasons: We may share information if required by law or in response to a valid legal process.
